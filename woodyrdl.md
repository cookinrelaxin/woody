# WoodyRDL

## Synopsis

The Woody Regular Description Language, or WoodyRDL for short, is the primary
interface by which users interact with Woody. Specifically users write files in
WoodyRDL, which Woody then reads and uses to generate the desired lexical
analyzer.

The purpose of a WoodyRDL file is to completely describe a set of tokens, which
are usually intended to be the tokens of a programming language.

## Examples

See example.woody for an example of a basic WoodyRDL file.

## Specification

For the nitty-gritty, see regular_description_specification.md
